## Fast Mean Shift (Dual Tree) Implementation

### Dual-Tree Mean Shift
Dual-Tree Mean Shift is an acceleration technique for computing the mean-shift algorithm. The idea is to use a kd-tree to represent both our query and reference sets, and use geometric properties of the partitioning of data to prune the tree.
